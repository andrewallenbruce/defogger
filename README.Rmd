[{defogger}](https://github.com/andrewallenbruce/defogger/) is a package
aimed at providing a collection of open-source tools for streamlining
the analysis workflow of Transparency in Coverage (TiC) files.

## Transparency in Coverage

> *Health plan price transparency helps consumers know the cost of a
> covered item or service before receiving care. Beginning July 1, 2022,
> most group health plans and issuers of group or individual health
> insurance will begin posting pricing information for covered items and
> services. This pricing information can be used by third parties, such
> as researchers and app developers to help consumers better understand
> the costs associated with their health care. More requirements will go
> into effect starting on January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024 which
> will provide additional access to pricing information and enhance
> consumers' ability to shop for the health care that best meet their
> needs.*[^1]

The [Transparency in Coverage Final
Rule](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/transparency-coverage-final-rule-fact-sheet-cms-9915-f)[^2]
requires most group health plans and issuers of group or individual
health insurance to disclose pricing information in the form of
machine-readable files containing the following sets of costs for items
and services:

-   **In-Network Rate File:** Rates for all covered items and services
    between the plan or issuer and in-network providers.
-   **Allowed Amount File:** Allowed amounts for, and billed charges
    from, out-of-network providers.

<br>

### A Unique Opportunity

[CMS.gov](https://www.cms.gov/) describes the situation perfectly:

>With the data contained in the machine-readable files from plans and
issuers, third party developers will be able to create much more
advanced and accurate price transparency tools. These tools will help
inform consumers, as well as the broader public, about patterns in
health care costs and will offer immense opportunities for innovation.

<br>

>Making price transparency information publicly available strengthens the
work of other health care stakeholders that help provide care or promote
access to care to consumers, or otherwise aim to protect consumers and
their interests in the health care system. These entities include
researchers, regulators, lawmakers, patient and consumer advocates, and
businesses that provide consumer support tools and services. A key
aspect of Transparency in Coverage is to make health care pricing
information more accessible and useful to consumers by making the
information available to persons and entities with the requisite
experience and expertise to assist individual consumers and other health
care purchasers to make informed health care decisions.

<br>

>With information on pricing, these other health care stakeholders can
better fulfill each of the unique roles they play to improve America's
health care system for consumers. For instance, with pricing
information, researchers could better assess the cost-effectiveness of
various treatments; state regulators could better review issuers'
proposed rate increases; patient advocates could better help guide
patients through care plans; employers could adopt incentives for
consumers to choose more cost-effective care; and entrepreneurs could
develop tools that help doctors better engage with patients.
