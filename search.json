Virtually modern programming languages support one form another. makes sense data format interchangeable programming languages also based structures.","code":""},{"path":"https://andrewallenbruce.github.io/defogger/articles/tic-overview.html","id":"transparency-in-coverage-definitions1","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Transparency in Coverage Definitions1","title":"Transparency in Coverage Guide","text":"section sets forth definitions price transparency requirements group health plans health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage.","code":""},{"path":"https://andrewallenbruce.github.io/defogger/authors.html","id":null,"dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Authors","title":"Authors and Citation","text":"Andrew Bruce.
