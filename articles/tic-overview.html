<h2 id="what-are-tic-files">What are TiC Files?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-are-tic-files"></a>
</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2020, HHS and the Departments of Labor and Treasury
finalized a <strong>Transparency in Coverage</strong> (TiC) Final Rule
(CMS-9115-F) requiring most health plans and issuers in the individual
and group commercial markets to disclose cost-sharing estimates and
additional content to enrollees upon request, and to publicly post
negotiated in-network provider rates, historical out-of-network allowed
amounts and billed charges, and drug pricing information, including
negotiated rates and historical net prices.</p>
<p>The final rule is the latest in a number of Administration efforts to
increase price transparency for healthcare services in order to empower
consumers to make informed decisions and to foster price competition in
the healthcare market. Beyond consumer empowerment, however, HHS clearly
articulates that its principle focus is on counteracting price
distortions and driving prices down in the commercial market.</p>
<p>Therefore, just as the Hospital Price Transparency Final Rule,
published in November in 2019 and set to take effect January 2021, has
faced strong stakeholder opposition and been the subject of legal
challenge, so too this final rule may likely be challenged by health
plans and other industry stakeholders. Indeed, HHS clearly anticipates
that this rule will face legal challenges and has included severability
clauses as part of the rule so that even if a portion of the rule is
challenged successfully, other provisions of the rule might continue to
survive.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-mrfs">What are MRFs?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-are-mrfs"></a>
</h2>
<p>A <strong>machine-readable file</strong> (MRF) is defined as a
digital representation of data or information in a file that can be
imported or read by a computer system for further processing without
human intervention, while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost. These
files are in the CMS defined format (JSON) and are not meant for a
member-friendly search of rates, benefits, or cost sharing. The table of
contents is an approved CMS schema approach that combines the in-network
rate files and references the locations (URLs) from which the
appropriate files can be downloaded.</p>
<p>The Transparency in Coverage Rule requires health insurers and group
health plans, including self-funded clients, to provide cost-sharing
data to consumers via these MRFs. They must be published on a publicly
available site based on the enforcement date of July 1, 2022 for plan
years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2022. These files provide pricing
data for covered items and services based on in-network negotiated
payment rates and historical out-of-network allowed amounts. A third
machine-readable file for prescription drug rates and historical costs
has been delayed pending further guidance. Information in these files
must be updated and published monthly. The machine-readable files must
be available on an internet website free of charge. The user is not
required to establish a user account, password, or other credentials and
does not require the user to submit any personal identifying information
such as a name, email address, or telephone number. Files are not
required if there are fewer than 20 claims for a service for a
provider.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>· Files have requirements regarding font size, accessibility, and
security settings.</p>
<p>· Files may be posted on a third party site.</p>
<p>· Files may not be a PDF or Excel.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-json">What is JSON?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-json"></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong> (JSON) is a lightweight
data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is
easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the
JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December
1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but
uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of
languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and
many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange
language.</p>
<p>JSON is built on two structures: A collection of name/value pairs. In
various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct,
dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array. An ordered
list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector,
list, or sequence. These are universal data structures. Virtually all
modern programming languages support them in one form or another. It
makes sense that a data format that is interchangeable with programming
languages also be based on these structures.</p>
